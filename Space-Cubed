Chapter 1

Once upon a time there lived an alien named James. 
James lived alone in the void of space. 
He had a quaint two story home built on a plot of land, the only land he could see.
It was a square plot of land 100 meters long, 100 meters tall, and 100 meters wide; a perfect cube.
As far as James knew, there were no other creatures like him, only the grass on his land and some birds and bugs.
