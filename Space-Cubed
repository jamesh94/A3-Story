Chapter 1

Once upon a time there lived an alien named James. 
James lived alone in the void of space. 
He had a quaint two story home built on a plot of land, the only land he could see.
It was a square plot of land 100 meters long, 100 meters tall, and 100 meters wide; a perfect cube.
As far as James knew, there were no other creatures like him, only the grass on his land and some birds and bugs.

Chapter 2

One day, James saw a strange aircraft of some sort on his land, and it was apparent that the aircraft had crashed.
James ran over to the wreckage and looked around it for some kind of indication as to where it had come from.
He couldn't see much from the outside; though it had crashed and was smoking, the aircraft was largely intact.
James decided to break down the door to see if there was anyone inside that might need help.
Inside, he found a smaller, creature.
Though it was apparent that it was the same species as him, the creature appeared to be smaller and looked a little different.

Chapter 3

James saw this creature in the wreaked spacecraft and said, "Hello, My name is James!"  
Of course his voice echoed off the 6 walls of the cube.  
Of course, he was accustomed to the echoing and did not hear it. 
His brain automatically filtered the echoes out. 
The creature answered back, naturally a little dazed sounding, "Hi, My name is Juliette.  Nice to meet you."  
Of course her voice echoed of the 6 walls of the cube and she covered her ears.  
She was not used to hearing so many echos.  
James was very happy to meet another person. He never had met another person before.
